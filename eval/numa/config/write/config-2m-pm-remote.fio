# This defines how many pieces of I/O to submit at once. It defaults to 1 which

# submit bigger batches of I/O at the time. If it is set to 0 the iodepth value
# will be used.

# Invalidate the buffer/page cache parts of the files to be used prior to starting

# If writing to a file, fio can verify the file contents after each iteration of

# In case of 'scramble_buffers=1', the source buffer
# is rewritten with a random value every write operation.
#
# But when 'scramble_buffers=0' is set, the source buffer isn't
# rewritten. So it will be likely that the source buffer is in CPU
# cache and it seems to be high write performance.

# Set this job’s memory policy and corresponding NUMA nodes. Format of the
# arguments:
#   <mode>[:<nodelist>]
# mode is one of the following memory policies: default, prefer, bind, interleave
# or local. For default and local memory policies, no node needs to be specified.
# For prefer, only one node is allowed. For bind and interleave the nodelist may
# be as follows: a comma delimited list of numbers, A-B ranges, or all.

# The libpmem engine does IO to files in a DAX-mounted filesystem.
# The filesystem should be created on a Non-Volatile DIMM (e.g /dev/pmem0)
# and then mounted with the '-o dax' option.  Note that the engine
# accesses the underlying NVDIMM directly, bypassing the kernel block
# layer, so the usual filesystem/disk performance monitoring tools such
# as iostat will not provide useful data.

# Tell fio to terminate processing after the specified period of time. It can be
# quite hard to determine for how long a specified job will run, so this
# parameter is handy to cap the total runtime to a given time. When the unit is
# omitted, the value is interpreted in seconds.
# runtime=

# If set, fio will run for the duration of the runtime specified even if the
# file(s) are completely read or written. It will simply loop over the same
# workload as many times as the runtime allows.

# Create the specified number of clones of this job. Each clone of job is
# spawned as an independent thread or process. May be used to setup a larger
# number of threads/processes doing the same thing. Each thread is reported
# separately; to see statistics for all clones as a whole, use group_reporting
# in conjunction with new_group. 
# numjobs=

# Controls the same options as cpumask, but accepts a textual specification of
# the permitted CPUs instead and CPUs are indexed from 0. So to use CPUs 0 and 5
# you would specify cpus_allowed=0,5. This option also allows a range of CPUs to
# be specified – say you wanted a binding to CPUs 0, 5, and 8 to 15, you would
# set cpus_allowed=0,5,8-15.
# cpus_allowed=

# Set this job running on specified NUMA nodes’ CPUs. The arguments allow comma

# options support, fio must be built on a system with libnuma-dev(el) installed.
